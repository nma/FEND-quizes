Your response goes here!

* What new skills have you learned?
There has been a lot more diverse and varied set of tags since the last time I looked into web development. Originally I assumed <menu>, <header>, <footer> were custom tags defined by bootstrap, but they are used because they are part of the web standard now!

* What has been easy?
Reading documentation and structuring searches. 

* What has been difficult?
To sit still and take the time to absorb and chunk the information properly.

* How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
I'm taking the time to properly take in the basics and not fall into the trap of overestimating my abilities.
